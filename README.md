# setup-meetup
This is a repo to start your org

## Intro
Welcome to the MEETUP! This page has everything you need to make it through the Craftwork workshop. If you don't see the next step, or you have questions that aren't answered by the [FAQ](workshop/FAQ.md), don't be afraid to raise your hand and ask us!

If you are viewing this as part of a ATO workshop, here is a [link to the slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18AIorSzf-h6JpZh0nXUg_wQzhCh7llE4/view?usp=sharing).

## Join this org

In order for you to get access to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and follow along, you will need to join the [github-craftwork](https://github.com/github-craftwork) organization. Coincidently we have written some automation to make that work. 

Invite yourself to the organization by typing  `.invite me` in [this issue](https://github.com/github-craftwork/start-here/issues/100).

Once you have submitted your comment, head over to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/github-craftwork/start-here/actions?workflow=Invite+a+contributor) for the the repo to find action triggered by your comment. 

Note that  this could take up to 30 seconds to show. Also be sure to check your email for that invite.
